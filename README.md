Brand Awareness and Funnel Dashboard Using Tableau for a survey generated by Python

Good morning,

Today, we will discuss two crucial aspects of market research - brand awareness and usage. Understanding your brand's position in the market is essential, and brand awareness and usage research help gauge how well-known your brand is, how often it's used, and what people think of it. You can gather this information through surveys, interviews, or focus groups.

In this survey, 1000 respondents were asked several questions about their brand awareness and usage for 10 different brands. The data for this survey was randomly generated using Python, and the dashboard was created using Tableau.

it consists of 3 files 

generated_survey_data.ipynb --> Python code that will randomly generate the survey 
final.csv --> output of the Python code.
editing.xlsx --> excel file to label the questions with its brands and question name.
